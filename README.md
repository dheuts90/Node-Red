# Node-Red
My Node-Red projects

You will find a flow I created to connect Node-Red to my Domoticz via MQTT, and see the Domoticz variables in a Node-Red Dashboard.

Before you can use this, you need to have a running Domoticz, MQTT broker like Mosquitto, and Node-Red installation.
Also, you will need to edit the IDX numbers and names to work with your devices.
